            <p>My name is Badar Zaman. I was originally born in Islamabad, Pakistan in 1998, but moved to America when I was 3. I live with my family, 3 siblings and my 
            mother. Somehow being the oldest I'm still the biggest baby in the family, but we've all since learned to deal with it. I graduated from Deer Park High School
            in 2017, and got my Bachelors Degree in Computer Information Systems and a minor in Business Management from Farmingdale State College in 2021. I've been working
            since the age of 17, from working as a cashier in Dunkin Donuts to working as an Adminstrative Assistant at State Farm for 3 years.</p>

            <p>When I first got into the field of Computer Science not one topic seemed easy enough to grasp. In the beginning I understood the concepts but aftwerwards 
            I would start getting confused on more complex topic and how to mesh everything together to get the right code or output. When I got into HTML and CSS however,
            I had a much easier time. I think it was because you could see your work live in demonstration even after one line of code, whereas other languages are heavily
            featured in the backend and get outputted to a terminal. Web developing I found was a chance for the programmer to ger creative and utilize your own styles and
            nuances. I regard myself to be a fun and creative person, and I think the field of web development would be a great place for me to thrive in.</p>
